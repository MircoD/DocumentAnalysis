\section*{Exercise 2}

The data file has a header (line 1-5), containing information about the format of the following data. Assumably the data is intended to be in a table format. The file contains amazon reviews about dvd's. Each review contains the following information: \\

\textit{productId, userId, profileName, helpfulness of the review, score for the movie, time, summary of the review, text} \\

\noindent Apparently, those reviews were not only written by ''normal'' users, but also by some ''experts'' (e.g. the first two reviews). 

For the product with the productId ''B00005CDCM'' (movie 'Space Cowboys'), there are a total of 121 reviews. Most of the reviews are very positive with a score of 4 or 5, except for some like the review of ''spacecadet007'', who thinks the movie is technically very inaccurate and recommends you shouldn't even rent this movie. But only 3 out of 13 people agree with him (helpfulness rating).

Some productId's are now inactive(e.g. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets).
